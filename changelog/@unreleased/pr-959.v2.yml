  description: |-
    Introduced jakarta equivalents of all modules which had a javax dependency

    Additionally had to do a few things:

    1. Migrated from spotify's ADT to derive4j which generates types without a legacy javax.annotation.Generated type
    2. Fixed a few tests
    3. Upgraded newer libraries to Junit5
